Every time I’ve had to build a marketing site for a company, large or small, the debate rages over which CMS should be used. Usually it comes to the conclusion that every CMS is terrible, so we’ll run with the least-awful one.

It’s time to drop that way of thinking entirely, and move to a CMS-less model. Static sites, which require no database or complex configuration to scale massively, are far easier to maintain and develop for, yet they’re often ignored.
