Roots is an advanced static site build tool that we've developed in house and used on quite a number of high-visibility projects, including the entirety of carrot.is. Much like jekyll, you can use roots for publishing and dynamic content, which makes it a great fit for building simple blogs. In this post, we'll walk through how to use roots to get a basic blog like this one built and deployed in a matter of minutes.
