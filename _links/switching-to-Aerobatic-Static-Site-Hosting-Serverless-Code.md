Aerobatic runs on AWS, so features like their CDN (actually CloudFront) and free SSL certificates (issued by ACM) are backed by familiar tools. The hugo-lambda templates cover some of the same ground, but Aerobatic also comes with a wealth of knowledge and best practices in its configuration. They set cache lifetimes, do URL rewriting, and build Jekyll or Hugo sites automatically.
