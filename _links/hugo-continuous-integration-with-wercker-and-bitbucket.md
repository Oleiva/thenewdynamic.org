Hugo is a slick static site generator built in Go, and is viewed by many developers as a better alternative to Jekyll. Wercker is a docker-based continuous integration (CI) tool that integrates nicely with Bitbucket. And Aerobatic, of course, is a static-hosting solution that integrates with Bitbucket via an add-on.
