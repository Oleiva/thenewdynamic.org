What is Gatsby? It’s a node module which weaves together React.js, React-Router, webpack, and webpack-static-site-generator. You get a nice development experience with hot-reload for page contents, styles and page structure, and you’re working with the same markup as what is generated to disk for production builds. It’s as simple as running gatsby develop or gatsby build on the command-line.
