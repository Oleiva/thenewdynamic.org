This release is a full rewrite. The Octopress CLI, among other things, will allow you to quickly create new pages, posts, drafts, and collections, deploy via Git, Rsync, and S3. Octopress Ink is a framework Iâ€™ve built for helping plugin authors rapidly build powerful plugins and themes for Jekyll sites. It has some crazy cool features.
