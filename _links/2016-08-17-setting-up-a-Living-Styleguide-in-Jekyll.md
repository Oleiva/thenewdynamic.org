I was recently working on a small Jekyll project and wanted to see whether it would be possible to have a very component-ized approach driven by a styleguide, despite the fact that Liquid (the template engine behind Jekyll) is not meant to do that.

I found it out it is doable (not without some struggling though) and Iâ€™d like to show you how so you can consider using a similar approach in your next Jekyll project.
