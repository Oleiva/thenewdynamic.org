The next time you build for the web, I ask you to consider the merits of static. Now that the modern development environments are nearly equal, ask these questions: Do the advantages of static outweigh it's disadvantages? How often will my project need to be updated and how close to real-time do I require those changes? Am I causing myself any unneeded overhead by adding the complexity of a server-side language and database? Which technique is going to be the most fun?
