Jekyll has a very flexible design that allows a great freedom of choice, allowing the user to simply introduce features that are not integrated into its engine. This is particularly the case when one wants to create a multilingual website: while CMS remain very rigid and often require plugins, few filters are sufficient to achieve it with Jekyll.
