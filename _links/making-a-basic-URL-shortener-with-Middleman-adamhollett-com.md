About a year ago, I bought admh.lt, a shortened version of my adamhollett.com domain name that also happens to be the slug I use for my username on many sites. admh.lt just redirects to adamhollett.com, but it retains anything else thatâ€™s been appended to the URL, so admh.lt/posts redirects to adamhollett.com/posts.
