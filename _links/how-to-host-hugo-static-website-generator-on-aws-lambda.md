In this tutorial we will create a static website publishing platform hosted in the cloud using several AWS services. It will run static website generator Hugo on AWS Lambda, store files in AWS S3 and serve them from AWS CloudFront. You will learn what these services do and set them up with easy-to-follow step by step instructions and screenshots.
