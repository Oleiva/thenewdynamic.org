In a previous post I wrote about the static html reprise explaining that most web pages only need to be built when the content or code has changed. Having your site like this can save you and your customers time and money, win-win situation. Most static site generators work from files in the codebase to get their content. Usually a Content Management System (CMS) is built into the site so non-technical authors can add and amend the content for the site, we need something to do this job for us. A solution to the problem is using a Software as a Service (SaaS)â€¦
