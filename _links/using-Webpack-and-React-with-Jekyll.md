Enter Webpack and npm, which gives me access to node modules that were previously something I’d only look at wistfully. I find trying to let Jekyll handle javascripts annoying and tedious, so I like that with this I’m able to use an ecosystem that is specifically designed to do major lifting in compilation, testing, and minification.
