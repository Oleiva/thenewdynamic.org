A server that listens for webhook posts from GitHub, generates a website with Jekyll, and moves it somewhere to be published. Use this to run your own GitHub Pages-style web server. Great for when you need to serve your websites behind a firewall, need extra server-level features like HTTP basic auth (see below for an NGINX config with basic auth), or want to host your site directly on a CDN or file host like S3. It's cutomizable with two user-configurable shell scripts and a config file.
