Jekyll and Cloudcannon make my life as a designer so much less hectic. What would have taken me hours and hours to setup on a Wordpress install only took me about 30 mins using Jekyll and Front Matter for a full featured photo gallery and CMS. WOW! It came down to time savings, ease for me, and speed of a static site. No annoying databases to deal with and no management of WP. Glorious! Not to mention Jekyll and Cloudcannon together make it beautiful and easy for the client to manage the photo gallery and website as a whole.
