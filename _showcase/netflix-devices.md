Netflix partnered with CloudCannon to rebuild [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com/). Devices was originally a Drupal site and was rebuilt in a fraction of the time using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The site is static so it loads quickly and reliably scales to the millions of Netflix visitors. The Partner Marketing team have taken control of their site. Theyâ€™re empowered to quickly try out new messaging and update content directly on the page. Netflix Devices is translated into 16 languages which all get served from the same Jekyll site.
