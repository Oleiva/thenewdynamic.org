Via the [Trello API](https://trello.com/docs/). We have a sub-200 LOC Ruby script that connects to the board (using the [Ruby Trello](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/ruby-trello) gem), loops over the lists, and outputs ERB (Ruby-embedded HTML) according to the rules laid out above. [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) consumes that output and produces HTML that is shipped off to [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/) for delivery.
