As a designer who loves to code, I wanted a way to combine the simplicity and joy of a static site builder with something that I could confidently deploy to clients with a fully functional, modern, VMC-based CMS. Webhook fits that need perfectly. It allows me to focus on the design and front-end development of a project while Webhook takes care of all the back-end functionality thatâ€™s required for most content driven/blog style sites today. The result is a beautiful, fully custom site that loads super fast without the usual development overhead of a custom site or the legacy bloat of a platform like WordPress.
